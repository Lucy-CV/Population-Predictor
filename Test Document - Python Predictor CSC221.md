| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| TC001 | Valid input (within range) | Test valid population prediction when input is between 1 and 50 years. | 1\. Run the program. 2\. Enter 10 as input for time in years. 3\. Observe the output. | Input: 10 | Population predicted \=  690,117,424 | The system remains in the ready state after output | 690,117,424 | Pass | Correct output.  |
| TC002 | Valid input (boundary test) | Test valid population prediction with boundary input values (1 and 50). | 1\. Run the program. 2\. Enter 1 as input for time in years. 3\. Observe the output. 4\. Run the program again. 5\. Enter 50 as input for time in years. 6\. Observe the output. | Input: 1, 50 | Predicted population after 1 year and 50 years should be calculated and displayed.  1 year:  362,622,288 50 years:  12,050,503,987 | The system remains in the ready state after output. | 1 year \=  362,622,288 50 years \=  12,050,503,987 | Pass | Boundary values produce correct outputs.  |
| TC003 | Invalid input (too high) | Test the program with an input greater than the valid range (above 50). | 1\. Run the program. 2\. Enter 100 as input for time in years. 3\. Observe the output | Input: 100 | The system should display an error message indicating the input is out of range. | The system should prompt for new input | Error: Number entered is outside the accepted range (1-50). Please try again. Would you like to predict again? (yes/no): | Pass | Inputs above 50 lead to error. |
| TC004 | Invalid input (too low) | Test the program with an input less than the valid range (below 1). | 1\. Run the program. 2\. Enter \-5 as input for time in years. 3\. Observe the output. | Input: \-5 | The system should display an error message indicating the input is out of range. | The system should prompt for new input. | Error: Number entered is outside the accepted range (1-50). Please try again. Would you like to predict again? (yes/no):  | Pass | Inputs less than 1 lead to error. |
| TC005 | Non-numeric input | Test the program when the user enters a non-numeric value for the years. | 1\. Run the program. 2\. Enter abc as input for time in years. 3\. Observe the output. | Input: abc | The system should display an error message indicating the input is invalid. | The system should prompt for new input. | Error: Please enter a valid number. Would you like to predict again? (yes/no):  | Pass | Non-numeric inputs lead to error. |
| TC006 | User decides to continue after prediction | Test if the program prompts for user input to continue or quit. | 1\. Run the program. 2\. Enter 10 as input for time in years. 3\. When asked "Would you like to predict again?", enter yes. 4\. Enter 5 as input for time in years. 5\. When asked "Would you like to predict again?", enter no. | Input: 10, yes, 5, no | The system should ask for new input after yes and exit after no. | The system should continue prompting after yes and exit after no. | The predicted population after 10.0 years is: 690,117,424 Would you like to predict again? (yes/no): yes Enter the time in years (1-50): 5 The predicted population after 5.0 years is: 482,683,791 Would you like to predict again? (yes/no): no Thank you for using the U.S. Population Predictor. Goodbye\! | Pass | User can continue and exit. |
| TC007 | Invalid input for continue prompt | Test invalid responses for the "continue" prompt (neither "yes" nor "no"). | 1\. Run the program. 2\. Enter 10 as input for time in years. 3\. When asked "Would you like to predict again?", enter maybe. 4\. Observe the output. 5\. Enter no to end the program. | Input: maybe, no | The system should display an error message asking for "yes" or "no" and ask again. | The system should continue asking until valid input is entered. | The predicted population after 10.0 years is: 690,117,424 Would you like to predict again? (yes/no): maybe Error: Please type 'yes' or 'no'. Would you like to predict again? (yes/no): no Thank you for using the U.S. Population Predictor. Goodbye\! | Pass | Entering ‘maybe’ leads to error. |
