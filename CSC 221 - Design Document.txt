Python Population Predictor
Design Document & Pseudocode




        
PROJECT OVERVIEW


________________




* Intent ~
   * Program will utilize the Python language, data about U.S. population growth trends, and arithmetic in order to predict a somewhat accurate estimation of the future U.S population after a variable amount of time. 
   * Information necessary ~
   * In order to complete this project, we will need to use statistical data about the current U.S. population size and the percent population change from year to year. → https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59697, https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59697#:~:text=Population%20Growth.,average%2C%20between%202045%20and%202054. 
   * We will also need to access the Numerical Python library so we can use Euler’s number in our calculations. 
   * Intended Audience ~
   * People curious about the potential future population of the United States. 
   * For what? ~
   * To see an estimation of what the population will be in the U.S. after a certain number of years (1-50), predicted solely on the previous growth trends of the last 20 years (average percent change from year to year). 
   * What do we do with it? ~
   * Use the exponential growth model of =   . Obviously, this is not at all the best growth model formula to use, but it is one that can produce values decently in line with reality and is simple enough for us to actually make a functional code given our time and knowledge limitations.
